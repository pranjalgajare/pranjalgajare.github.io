I am Pranjal Gajare, a PhD Student at the School of Computer and Electrical Engineering at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I am affiliated with the [Center for Distributed Energy (CDE) at Georgia Tech](https://cde.gatech.edu/), where I am advised by [Prof. Deepak Divan](https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/deepakraj-m-divan). I graduated with my Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/) and am fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Anubrata Dey](https://www.iitr.ac.in/~EE/Anubrata_Dey). During my undergraduate degree, I was a visiting researcher with the [Chair of Power Electronics at Kiel University](https://www.uni-kiel.de/en/tf/research/institute-etit/power-electronics) with [Prof. Marco Liserre](https://www.uni-kiel.de/en/person/liserre-marco-50519).

My research interests broadly revolve around Power Electronics and its applications to Power Systems, which are driven by the explosive growth of distributed energy resources on the grid. My current research interests include the study of interactions in multi-inverter systems and designing controls of inverters to prevent adverse interactions. I have also worked on current sensor design for utility applications in the early part of my PhD. During my undergraduate studies, I worked on converter hardware and control design for multilevel inverters, including MMCs, 3L-NPC, and ANPC for medium voltage drives and active power filter applications.

## Projects

### Control Design to Mitigate Interactions in Multi-Inverter Systems
* **Description:** This research focuses on developing and validating advanced control strategies for grid-forming and grid-following inverters. The primary goal is to prevent adverse interactions, such as harmonic resonance and instability, in power systems with high penetration of renewable energy sources.
* **Skills:** Control Theory, Power Systems Modeling, MATLAB/Simulink, Real-Time Simulation (dSPACE/Typhoon HIL).
* **Associated Publication:** [Link to your paper here, if available](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/)

### Hardware and Control of a 3-Level ANPC Inverter for Active Power Filters
* **Description:** As part of my undergraduate work, I designed, simulated, and built a laboratory prototype of a 3-Level Active Neutral Point Clamped (ANPC) multilevel inverter. The project involved PCB design, DSP programming, and implementing control algorithms for active power filtering to improve power quality.
* **Skills:** Hardware Design (Altium/KiCad), PCB Prototyping, Embedded C, DSP Programming (TI C2000), Converter Control.
* **Code Repository:** [Link to your GitHub repo here, if available](https://github.com/)

### How to Customize It:

1.  **Main Heading:** The line `## Projects` creates the main heading for the section. The `##` is Markdown syntax for an H2 header.
2.  **Project Heading:** Each `### Project Title` creates a new entry for a project. The `###` is for an H3 header, creating a nice sub-section.
3.  **Project Details:**
    * I've used a bulleted list (`*`) for the description and skills, as it's clean and easy to scan.
    * **Bold text** (`**Bold text**`) makes the categories like "Skills" stand out.
    * **Links:** The syntax for a link is `[Text to display](URL)`. Replace the placeholder URLs with links to your papers, GitHub, or a more detailed project page. If you don't have a link, you can just delete that line.
4.  **Add More Projects:** To add another project, just copy and paste the entire block starting from `###` and fill in your own details.
