I am Pranjal, an ECE PhD Student at the School of Computer and Electrical Engineering at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I am affiliated with the [Center for Distributed Energy (CDE) at Georgia Tech](https://cde.gatech.edu/), where I am advised by [Prof. Deepak Divan](https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/deepakraj-m-divan). I graduated with my Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/) and am fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Anubrata Dey](https://www.iitr.ac.in/~EE/Anubrata_Dey). During my undergraduate degree, I was a visiting researcher with the [Chair of Power Electronics at Kiel University](https://www.uni-kiel.de/en/tf/research/institute-etit/power-electronics) with [Prof. Marco Liserre](https://www.uni-kiel.de/en/person/liserre-marco-50519)

My research interests broadly revolve around Power Electronics and its applications to Power Systems. My current research interests include the study of interactions in multi-inverter systems and designing controls of inverters to prevent adverse interactions. I have also worked on current sensor design for utility applications in the early part of my PhD. During my undergraduate degree, I worked on converter hardware and control design for multilevel inverters including MMCs, 3L-NPC, and ANPC for medium voltage drives and active power filter applications.
